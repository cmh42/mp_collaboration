# Version Control

### Preliminaries

We will be using SSH authentification. 
The following instructions are for setting up SSH authentification on a Mac. Do a quick web search using the items to get instructions for other operating systems.

1. [Check for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
2. [Generate a new SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#about-ssh-key-passphrases)
3. [Add the SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)


## Version control, Git and Github

These instructions are based on the following page: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git

### Example 
We will construct a repository called `mp_work` and perform various file and version control operations on it.  

The work here is based on the page: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git

#### Part 1: Start a new repository and publish it to GitHub

Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. (You need to create an account on Github first and then create a repository.  A suggested example of creating a repoistory is [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world).) In the present example I created an empty repository 
called `my_work`.
